## Introduction:
In this Pandemic time, Most of us have faced a lot of problems and difficulties,and we all have waited for vaccines to be created as soon as possible. And now the prominent pharmaceutical companies have created vaccine with effective result after many phase trials.
So keeping in mind about the distribution of vaccines among the hospitals across the country, we have come up with an idea of creating an app for distributing the vaccine and allocating the vaccine for the deserving candidates.

We are going to create the app with Doctors as End-User, where he/she gets to add patients who need vaccine. After the doctor adds a patient data, the app will take the patient's data, sort it according to the diseasesâ€™ fatality and age of the patient. After this the app will display the waiting list of patients according to the Priority Constraints given by us.
After that, we will take in account the number of vaccines available and allocate it to the patients on the top of the sorted list. After that, the patient who is vaccinated, will be removed from the waiting list and added to the displayed list in the Covix App.
